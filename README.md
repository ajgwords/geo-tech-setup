# geo-tech-setup
## what is this?
This is an attempt to create a working but relatively lightweight linux installation for use with geospatial tools i.e. something that I will be running as my daily driver for both work and personal machines.

## get started with the install 
1) download Fedora Sway:
2) install Fedora Sway (make sure that you have sudo set up)
3) optional distro upgrade
4) install git
5) clone this repo 
6) run bash install.sh

## more about the base install
Fedora Sway - link, about
tick "add administrative privilages to thi user account"

# notes about this repo 
do we need mamba install?
is flatpak a sensible choice?

change machine domain name if required
